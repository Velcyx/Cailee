# Cailee | Computer Assisted Imaging for Lung Examination & Evaluation.
Cailee is a terminal-based YOLOv11 engine for 1024p lung cancer detection. Optimized for AMD 7900 XTX via ROCm, it handles 15k X-rays at high resolution to preserve small-nodule features. Features headless API-driven training and inference scripts for consumer-grade GPU clusters. Back-end only; GUI implementation pending.
